/**弱引用对象，不会阻止它们的引用对象被终结、终结和回收。弱引用最常用于实现规范化映射。
 * Weak reference objects, which do not prevent their referents from being

 * often used to implement canonicalizing mappings.
 *
 * 假设垃圾收集器在某个时间点确定一个对象是弱可达的。
 * 那时它将原子地清除对该对象的所有弱引用以及对任何其他弱可达对象的所有弱引用，通过强引用和软引用链可以从中访问该对象。
 * <p> Suppose that the garbage collector determines at a certain point in time
 * that an object is <a href="package-summary.html#reachability">weakly
 * reachable</a>.  At that time it will atomically clear all weak references to
 * that object and all weak references to any other weakly-reachable objects
 * from which that object is reachable through a chain of strong and soft
 * references.  At the same time it will declare all of the formerly
 * weakly-reachable objects to be finalizable.  At the same time or at some
 * later time it will enqueue those newly-cleared weak references that are
 * registered with reference queues.
